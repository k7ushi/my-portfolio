Personal Portfolio – www.khushianand.com

This is my personal developer portfolio, a fully custom-built site that reflects my skills, work, and creative process. Designed and developed from scratch using the MERN stack, it's my digital home for all things code, design, and dev energy.

About 

This portfolio is more than just a site, it's a statement.  
A space that brings together who I am, what I build, and how I think.

Every section is handcrafted, with no templates or shortcuts.  
From smooth UI transitions and responsive layouts to backend logic and dynamic content management, the goal was simple: create something intentional, functional, and aesthetically pleasing.
